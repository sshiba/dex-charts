Airship Charts
==============

The Airship ``charts`` repository is home to a collection of Helm charts
developed and maintained by the Airship community, generally for
Airship- or Airship-adjacent use cases.

To learn more about the Airship 2.0 evolution, reference the
`Airship blog series`_.

Contributing
------------

The Airship team prefers to use upstream Helm charts, maintained by the
deployed projects themselves, as much as possible.  Therefore, charts are
only added to this ``charts`` repo when truly needed.  Our community practice
is to propose and defend the need for a new chart in our weekly IRC meeting
(mirrored in our Slack channel).  Please bring a new chart up in that forum
prior to pushing a patchset to add it.

To get looped into our team meetings and community, please visit the
`Airship wiki`_, and read our `developer guide`_ to begin contributing.

We also encourage new contributors and operators alike to join us in our
`Slack workspace`_ and subscribe to our `mailing lists`_.
